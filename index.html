            Daenerys is most often described as uncommonly beautiful, with long, pale silver-gold hair and eyes like amethysts. She is
            slender and pale, although taller than some of her female ancestors. Tales of Daenerys' beauty are numerous, and throughout the
            novels she encounters countless suitors who seek her hand in marriage, sometimes to gain control of her three dragons. She is
            fluent in the Common Tongue of Westeros as well as in High Valyrian and bastard Valyrian, which she speaks with a Tyroshi
            accent. Over the course of the first three novels she becomes fluent in the Dothraki language as well as Ghiscari, spoken by the
            slave cities in Essos.

            Daenerys grew up in constant fear of being discovered and killed by agents of the Usurper King, Robert Baratheon, and was
            frequently abused by her older brother Viserys, which led to her developing a fearful, submissive, and furtive nature. However,
            over the course of the narrative Daenerys comes to find her inner strength and courage and merges as a natural leader who is
            adored by her people. She is often described as honorable and compassionate, if somewhat na√Øve, although she can be harsh and
            vengeful against those who seek to harm her or her followers.
